CLP(SMT)-miniKanren
===================

Canonical miniKanren implementation, augmented with CLP(SMT).

Added SMT hooks: `z/assert` takes a boolean arithmetic expression with variables (integer by default), `z/` takes an SMT statement.

Background on miniKanren

William E. Byrd, Eric Holk, and Daniel P. Friedman.
